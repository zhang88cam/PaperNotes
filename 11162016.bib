  abstract={We consider the problem of representing and reasoning about computer programs, and propose a translation from a core procedural iterative programming language to first-order logic with quantification over the domain of natural numbers that includes the usual successor function and the “less than” linear order, essentially a first-order logic with a discrete linear order. Unlike Hoare's logic, our approach does not rely on loop invariants. Unlike the typical temporal logic specification of a program, our translation does not require a transition system model of the program, and is compositional on the structures of the program. Some non-trivial examples are given to show the effectiveness of our translation for proving properties of programs.},

  abstract={Estimation of parameters of chaotic systems is a subject of substantial and well-developed research issue in nonlinear science. From the viewpoint of optimization, parameter estimation can be formulated as a multi-modal constrained optimization problem with multiple decision variables. This investigation makes a systematic examination of the feasibility of applying a newly proposed population-based optimization method labeled here as teaching–learning-based optimization {(TLBO)} to identify the unknown parameters for a class of chaotic system. The preliminary test demonstrates that despite its global fast coarse search capability, teaching–learning-based optimization often risks getting prematurely stuck in local optima. To enhance its fine (local) searching performance of {TLBO,} {Nelder–Mead} simplex algorithm-based local improvement is incorporated into {TLBO} so as to continually search for the global optima through the reflection, expansion, contraction, and shrink operators. Working with the well-established Lorenz system, we assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed improved {TLBO} strategy. The empirical results indicate the success of the proposed hybrid approach in which the global exploration and the local exploitation are well balanced, providing the best solutions for all instances used over other state-of-the-art metaheuristics for chaotic identification in literature, including particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm.},

  abstract={We consider an optimization problem in which the cost of a feasible solution depends on a set of unknown parameters (scenario) that will be realized. In order to assess the cost of implementing a given solution, its performance is compared with the optimal one under each feasible scenario. The positive difference between the objective values of both solutions defines the regret corresponding to a fixed scenario. The proposed optimization model will seek for a compromise solution by minimizing the expected regret where the expectation is taken respect to a probability distribution that depends on the same solution that is being evaluated, which is called solution-dependent probability distribution. We study the optimization model obtained by applying a specific family of solution-dependent probability distributions to the shortest path problem where the unknown parameters are the arc lengths of the network. This approach can be used to generate new models for robust optimization where the degree of conservatism is calibrated by using different families of probability distributions for the unknown parameters.},
