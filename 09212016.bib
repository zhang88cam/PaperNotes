  abstract={Robots have transformed many industries, most notably manufacturing, and have the power to deliver tremendous benefits to society, such as in search and rescue, disaster response, health care and transportation. They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot /‘think outside the box/' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot/'s prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury.},

  abstract={The ability of an Evolutionary Algorithm {(EA)} to find a global optimal solution depends on its capacity to find a good rate between exploitation of found-so-far elements and exploration of the search space. Inspired by natural phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves complex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration-exploitation balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of Matter Search {(SMS)} is introduced. The {SMS} algorithm is based on the simulation of the states of matter phenomenon. In {SMS,} individuals emulate molecules which interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is devised by considering each state of matter at one different exploration–exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities of exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is reached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance between exploration–exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities of an evolutionary approach. To illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods including novel variants that incorporate diversity preservation schemes. The comparison examines several standard benchmark functions which are commonly considered within the {EA} field. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good performance in comparison to its counterparts as a consequence of its better exploration–exploitation balance.},

  abstract={A binary {CSP} instance satisfying the broken-triangle property {(BTP)} can be solved in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in practice, few instances satisfy the {BTP.} We show that a local version of the {BTP} allows the merging of domain values in arbitrary instances of binary {CSP,} thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation. Extensive experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a significant decrease in instance size for certain classes of problems. We show that {BTP-merging} can be generalised to instances with constraints of arbitrary arity and we investigate the theoretical relationship with resolution in {SAT.} A directional version of general-arity {BTP-merging} then allows us to extend the {BTP} tractable class previously defined only for binary {CSP.} We investigate the complexity of several related problems including the recognition problem for the general-arity {BTP} class when the variable order is unknown, finding an optimal order in which to apply {BTP} merges and detecting {BTP-merges} in the presence of global constraints such as {AllDifferent.}},

  abstract={The standard way of answering queries over incomplete databases is to compute certain answers, defined as the intersection of query answers on all complete databases that the incomplete database represents. But is this universally accepted definition correct? We argue that this “one-size-fits-all” definition can often lead to counterintuitive or just plain wrong results, and propose an alternative framework for defining certain {answers.The} idea of the framework is to move away from the standard, in the database literature, assumption that query results be given in the form of a database object, and to allow instead two alternative representations of answers: as objects defining all other answers, or as knowledge we can deduce with certainty about all such answers. We show that the latter is often easier to achieve than the former, that in general certain answers need not be defined as intersection, and may well contain missing values in them. We also show that with a proper choice of semantics, we can often reduce computing certain answers – as either objects or knowledge – to standard query evaluation. We describe the framework in the most general way, applicable to a variety of data models, and test it on three concrete relational semantics of incompleteness: open, closed, and weak closed world.},

  abstract={First impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces, and despite their questionable validity they can have considerable real-world consequences. We sought to uncover the information driving such judgments, using an attribute-based approach. Attributes (physical facial features) were objectively measured from feature positions and colors in a database of highly variable "ambient" face photographs, and then used as input for a neural network to model factor dimensions (approachability, youthful-attractiveness, and dominance) thought to underlie social attributions. A linear model based on this approach was able to account for 58\% of the variance in raters' impressions of previously unseen faces, and factor-attribute correlations could be used to rank attributes by their importance to each factor. Reversing this process, neural networks were then used to predict facial attributes and corresponding image properties from specific combinations of factor scores. In this way, the factors driving social trait impressions could be visualized as a series of computer-generated cartoon face-like images, depicting how attributes change along each dimension. This study shows that despite enormous variation in ambient images of faces, a substantial proportion of the variance in first impressions can be accounted for through linear changes in objectively defined features.},

  abstract={Chemical Reaction Optimization {(CRO)} is a recently established metaheuristics for optimization, inspired by the nature of chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is a natural process of transforming the unstable substances to the stable ones. In microscopic view, a chemical reaction starts with some unstable molecules with excessive energy. The molecules interact with each other through a sequence of elementary reactions. At the end, they are converted to those with minimum energy to support their existence. This property is embedded in {CRO} to solve optimization problems. {CRO} can be applied to tackle problems in both the discrete and continuous domains. We have successfully exploited {CRO} to solve a broad range of engineering problems, including the quadratic assignment problem, neural network training, multimodal continuous problems, etc. The simulation results demonstrate that {CRO} has superior performance when compared with other existing optimization algorithms. This tutorial aims to assist the readers in implementing {CRO} to solve their problems. It also serves as a technical overview of the current development of {CRO} and provides potential future research directions.},

  abstract={During the past decade, solving constrained optimization problems with swarm algorithms has received considerable attention among researchers and practitioners. In this paper, a novel swarm algorithm called the Social Spider Optimization {(SSO-C)} is proposed for solving constrained optimization tasks. The {SSO-C} algorithm is based on the simulation of cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typically found in the colony. For constraint handling, the proposed algorithm incorporates the combination of two different paradigms in order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space. In particular, it has been added: (1) a penalty function which introduces a tendency term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (2) a feasibility criterion to bias the generation of new individuals toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions. In order to illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods. Simulation and comparisons based on several well-studied benchmarks functions and real-world engineering problems demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and stability of the proposed method.},

  abstract={The league championship algorithm {(LCA)} is a new algorithm originally proposed for unconstrained optimization which tries to metaphorically model a League championship environment wherein artificial teams play in an artificial league for several weeks (iterations). Given the league schedule, a number of individuals, as sport teams, play in pairs and their game outcome is determined given known the playing strength (fitness value) along with the team formation (solution). Modelling an artificial match analysis, each team devises the required changes in its formation (a new solution) for the next week contest and the championship goes for a number of seasons. In this paper, we adapt {LCA} for constrained optimization. In particular: (1) a feasibility criterion to bias the search toward feasible regions is included besides the objective value criterion; (2) generation of multiple offspring is allowed to increase the probability of an individual to generate a better solution; (3) a diversity mechanism is adopted, which allows infeasible solutions with a promising objective value precede the feasible solutions. Performance of {LCA} is compared with comparator algorithms on benchmark problems where the experimental results indicate that {LCA} is a very competitive algorithm. Performance of {LCA} is also evaluated on well-studied mechanical design problems and results are compared with the results of 21 constrained optimization algorithms. Computational results signify that with a smaller number of evaluations, {LCA} ensures finding the true optimum of these problems. These results encourage that further developments and applications of {LCA} would be worth investigating in the future studies.},

  abstract={Clustering has been widely used in different fields of science, technology, social science, etc. Naturally, clusters are in arbitrary (non-convex) shapes in a dataset. One important class of clustering is distance based method. However, distance based clustering methods usually find clusters of convex shapes. Classical single-link is a distance based clustering method, which can find arbitrary shaped clusters. It scans dataset multiple times and has time requirement of O(n2), where n is the size of the dataset. This is potentially a severe problem for a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a distance based clustering method, {l-SL} to find arbitrary shaped clusters in a large dataset. In this method, first leaders clustering method is applied to a dataset to derive a set of leaders; subsequently single-link method (with distance stopping criteria) is applied to the leaders set to obtain final clustering. The {l-SL} method produces a flat clustering. It is considerably faster than the single-link method applied to dataset directly. Clustering result of the {l-SL} may deviate nominally from final clustering of the single-link method (distance stopping criteria) applied to dataset directly. To compensate deviation of the {l-SL,} an improvement method is also proposed. Experiments are conducted with standard real world and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering methods for large datasets.},

In the latter, optimality leads to the efficient transmission of information with a minimum number of connections. Whilst studies show that differences in centrality exist in animal networks with central individuals having higher fitness, network efficiency has never been studied in animal groups. Here we studied 78 groups of primates (24 species). We found that group size and neocortex ratio were correlated with network efficiency. Centralisation (whether several individuals are central in the group) and modularity (how a group is clustered) had opposing effects on network efficiency, showing that tolerant species have more efficient networks. Such network properties affecting individual fitness could be shaped by natural selection. Our results are in accordance with the social brain and cultural intelligence hypotheses, which suggest that the importance of network efficiency and information flow through social learning relates to cognitive abilities.},
