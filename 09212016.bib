  abstract={Robots have transformed many industries, most notably manufacturing, and have the power to deliver tremendous benefits to society, such as in search and rescue, disaster response, health care and transportation. They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot /‘think outside the box/' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot/'s prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury.},

  abstract={The ability of an Evolutionary Algorithm {(EA)} to find a global optimal solution depends on its capacity to find a good rate between exploitation of found-so-far elements and exploration of the search space. Inspired by natural phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves complex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration-exploitation balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of Matter Search {(SMS)} is introduced. The {SMS} algorithm is based on the simulation of the states of matter phenomenon. In {SMS,} individuals emulate molecules which interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is devised by considering each state of matter at one different exploration–exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities of exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is reached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance between exploration–exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities of an evolutionary approach. To illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods including novel variants that incorporate diversity preservation schemes. The comparison examines several standard benchmark functions which are commonly considered within the {EA} field. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good performance in comparison to its counterparts as a consequence of its better exploration–exploitation balance.},

  abstract={A binary {CSP} instance satisfying the broken-triangle property {(BTP)} can be solved in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in practice, few instances satisfy the {BTP.} We show that a local version of the {BTP} allows the merging of domain values in arbitrary instances of binary {CSP,} thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation. Extensive experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a significant decrease in instance size for certain classes of problems. We show that {BTP-merging} can be generalised to instances with constraints of arbitrary arity and we investigate the theoretical relationship with resolution in {SAT.} A directional version of general-arity {BTP-merging} then allows us to extend the {BTP} tractable class previously defined only for binary {CSP.} We investigate the complexity of several related problems including the recognition problem for the general-arity {BTP} class when the variable order is unknown, finding an optimal order in which to apply {BTP} merges and detecting {BTP-merges} in the presence of global constraints such as {AllDifferent.}},

  abstract={The standard way of answering queries over incomplete databases is to compute certain answers, defined as the intersection of query answers on all complete databases that the incomplete database represents. But is this universally accepted definition correct? We argue that this “one-size-fits-all” definition can often lead to counterintuitive or just plain wrong results, and propose an alternative framework for defining certain {answers.The} idea of the framework is to move away from the standard, in the database literature, assumption that query results be given in the form of a database object, and to allow instead two alternative representations of answers: as objects defining all other answers, or as knowledge we can deduce with certainty about all such answers. We show that the latter is often easier to achieve than the former, that in general certain answers need not be defined as intersection, and may well contain missing values in them. We also show that with a proper choice of semantics, we can often reduce computing certain answers – as either objects or knowledge – to standard query evaluation. We describe the framework in the most general way, applicable to a variety of data models, and test it on three concrete relational semantics of incompleteness: open, closed, and weak closed world.},

  abstract={First impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces, and despite their questionable validity they can have considerable real-world consequences. We sought to uncover the information driving such judgments, using an attribute-based approach. Attributes (physical facial features) were objectively measured from feature positions and colors in a database of highly variable "ambient" face photographs, and then used as input for a neural network to model factor dimensions (approachability, youthful-attractiveness, and dominance) thought to underlie social attributions. A linear model based on this approach was able to account for 58\% of the variance in raters' impressions of previously unseen faces, and factor-attribute correlations could be used to rank attributes by their importance to each factor. Reversing this process, neural networks were then used to predict facial attributes and corresponding image properties from specific combinations of factor scores. In this way, the factors driving social trait impressions could be visualized as a series of computer-generated cartoon face-like images, depicting how attributes change along each dimension. This study shows that despite enormous variation in ambient images of faces, a substantial proportion of the variance in first impressions can be accounted for through linear changes in objectively defined features.},

  abstract={Chemical Reaction Optimization {(CRO)} is a recently established metaheuristics for optimization, inspired by the nature of chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is a natural process of transforming the unstable substances to the stable ones. In microscopic view, a chemical reaction starts with some unstable molecules with excessive energy. The molecules interact with each other through a sequence of elementary reactions. At the end, they are converted to those with minimum energy to support their existence. This property is embedded in {CRO} to solve optimization problems. {CRO} can be applied to tackle problems in both the discrete and continuous domains. We have successfully exploited {CRO} to solve a broad range of engineering problems, including the quadratic assignment problem, neural network training, multimodal continuous problems, etc. The simulation results demonstrate that {CRO} has superior performance when compared with other existing optimization algorithms. This tutorial aims to assist the readers in implementing {CRO} to solve their problems. It also serves as a technical overview of the current development of {CRO} and provides potential future research directions.},

  abstract={During the past decade, solving constrained optimization problems with swarm algorithms has received considerable attention among researchers and practitioners. In this paper, a novel swarm algorithm called the Social Spider Optimization {(SSO-C)} is proposed for solving constrained optimization tasks. The {SSO-C} algorithm is based on the simulation of cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typically found in the colony. For constraint handling, the proposed algorithm incorporates the combination of two different paradigms in order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space. In particular, it has been added: (1) a penalty function which introduces a tendency term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (2) a feasibility criterion to bias the generation of new individuals toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions. In order to illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods. Simulation and comparisons based on several well-studied benchmarks functions and real-world engineering problems demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and stability of the proposed method.},

  abstract={The league championship algorithm {(LCA)} is a new algorithm originally proposed for unconstrained optimization which tries to metaphorically model a League championship environment wherein artificial teams play in an artificial league for several weeks (iterations). Given the league schedule, a number of individuals, as sport teams, play in pairs and their game outcome is determined given known the playing strength (fitness value) along with the team formation (solution). Modelling an artificial match analysis, each team devises the required changes in its formation (a new solution) for the next week contest and the championship goes for a number of seasons. In this paper, we adapt {LCA} for constrained optimization. In particular: (1) a feasibility criterion to bias the search toward feasible regions is included besides the objective value criterion; (2) generation of multiple offspring is allowed to increase the probability of an individual to generate a better solution; (3) a diversity mechanism is adopted, which allows infeasible solutions with a promising objective value precede the feasible solutions. Performance of {LCA} is compared with comparator algorithms on benchmark problems where the experimental results indicate that {LCA} is a very competitive algorithm. Performance of {LCA} is also evaluated on well-studied mechanical design problems and results are compared with the results of 21 constrained optimization algorithms. Computational results signify that with a smaller number of evaluations, {LCA} ensures finding the true optimum of these problems. These results encourage that further developments and applications of {LCA} would be worth investigating in the future studies.},

  abstract={Clustering has been widely used in different fields of science, technology, social science, etc. Naturally, clusters are in arbitrary (non-convex) shapes in a dataset. One important class of clustering is distance based method. However, distance based clustering methods usually find clusters of convex shapes. Classical single-link is a distance based clustering method, which can find arbitrary shaped clusters. It scans dataset multiple times and has time requirement of O(n2), where n is the size of the dataset. This is potentially a severe problem for a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a distance based clustering method, {l-SL} to find arbitrary shaped clusters in a large dataset. In this method, first leaders clustering method is applied to a dataset to derive a set of leaders; subsequently single-link method (with distance stopping criteria) is applied to the leaders set to obtain final clustering. The {l-SL} method produces a flat clustering. It is considerably faster than the single-link method applied to dataset directly. Clustering result of the {l-SL} may deviate nominally from final clustering of the single-link method (distance stopping criteria) applied to dataset directly. To compensate deviation of the {l-SL,} an improvement method is also proposed. Experiments are conducted with standard real world and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering methods for large datasets.},

In the latter, optimality leads to the efficient transmission of information with a minimum number of connections. Whilst studies show that differences in centrality exist in animal networks with central individuals having higher fitness, network efficiency has never been studied in animal groups. Here we studied 78 groups of primates (24 species). We found that group size and neocortex ratio were correlated with network efficiency. Centralisation (whether several individuals are central in the group) and modularity (how a group is clustered) had opposing effects on network efficiency, showing that tolerant species have more efficient networks. Such network properties affecting individual fitness could be shaped by natural selection. Our results are in accordance with the social brain and cultural intelligence hypotheses, which suggest that the importance of network efficiency and information flow through social learning relates to cognitive abilities.},

  abstract={In this paper, we intend to propose a new heuristic optimization method, called animal migration optimization algorithm. This algorithm is inspired by the animal migration behavior, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can be found in all major animal groups, such as birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans. In our algorithm, there are mainly two processes. In the first process, the algorithm simulates how the groups of animals move from the current position to the new position. During this process, each individual should obey three main rules. In the latter process, the algorithm simulates how some animals leave the group and some join the group during the migration. In order to verify the performance of our approach, 23 benchmark functions are employed. The proposed method has been compared with other well-known heuristic search methods. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than or at least comparable with state-of-the-art approaches from literature when considering the quality of the solution obtained.},

  abstract={We research the problem of building knowledge maps of graph-like information. There exist well-consolidated cartographic principles and techniques for mapping physical landscapes. However, we live in the digital era and similarly to the Earth, the Web is simply too large and its interrelations too complex for anyone to grasp much of it through direct observation. Thus, the problem of applying cartographic principles also to digital landscapes is intriguing. We introduce a mathematical formalism that captures the general notion of map of a graph and enables its development and manipulation in a semi-automated way. We present an implementation of our formalism on the Web of Linked Data graph and discuss algorithms that efficiently generate and combine (via an algebra) regions and maps. We present the {MaGe} tool, implementing the map framework, and discuss examples of knowledge maps.},

  abstract={We propose and analyze a novel framework for learning sparse representations based on two statistical techniques: kernel smoothing and marginal regression. The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incorporating feature similarity or temporal information present in data sets via non-parametric kernel smoothing. We provide generalization bounds for dictionary learning using smooth sparse coding and show how the sample complexity depends on the L1 norm of kernel function used. Furthermore, we propose using marginal regression for obtaining sparse codes which significantly improves the speed and allows one to scale to large dictionary sizes easily. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, both in terms of accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation on several real data sets. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used for improving semi-supervised sparse coding.},

  abstract={Boolean satisfiability {(SAT)} solving is one of the most competitive research areas of theoretical computer science. The performance of state-of-the-art {SAT} solvers has been continuously improving in the last decades and has reached a level where {SAT} solvers can be employed to solve real world problems in fields such as hardware and software verification, automated planning and many others. One of the important driving forces of this progress are the yearly organized (since 2002) {SAT} competitions. In this paper we describe the 2015 {SAT} Race that featured the traditional sequential and parallel tracks (with 64 core computers) and introduced the Incremental Library Track, which is particularly interesting for developers of {SAT} based applications. We describe the 2015 {SAT} Race and provide a detailed analysis of its results.},

  abstract={We present a new learning scheme for solvers of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem {(CSP),} which is based on learning (general) constraints rather than the generalized no-goods or signed-clauses that were used in the past. The new scheme is integrated in a conflict-analysis algorithm reminiscent of a modern systematic propositional satisfiability {(SAT)} solver: it traverses the conflict graph backwards and gradually builds an asserting conflict constraint. This construction is based on new inference rules that are tailored for various pairs of constraints types, e.g., x≤y1+k1 and x≥y2+k2, or y1≤x and [x,y2]⊈[a,b]. The learned constraint is stronger than what can be learned via signed resolution. Our experiments show that our solver {HCSP} backtracks orders of magnitude less than other state-of-the-art solvers, and is overall on par with the winner of this year's {MiniZinc} challenge.},

  abstract={Nowadays, modern {SAT} solvers are able to efficiently solve many industrial, or real-world, {SAT} instances. However, the process of development and testing of new {SAT} solving techniques is conditioned to the finite and reduced number of known industrial benchmarks. Therefore, new models of random {SAT} instances generation that capture realistically the features of real-world problems can be beneficial to the {SAT} community. In many works, the structure of industrial instances has been analyzed representing them as graphs and studying some of their properties, like {modularity.In} this work, we use the notion of modularity to define a new model of generation of random {SAT} instances with community structure, called Community Attachment. For high values of modularity (i.e., clear community structure), we realistically model pseudo-industrial random {SAT} formulas. This model also generates {SAT} instances very similar to classical random formulas using a low value of modularity. We also prove that the phase transition point, if exists, is independent on the modularity. We evaluate the adequacy of this model to real industrial {SAT} problems in terms of {SAT} solvers performance, and show that modern solvers do actually exploit this community structure. Finally, we use this generator to observe the connections between the modularity of the instance and some components of the solver, such as the variable branching heuristics or the clause learning mechanism.},

  abstract={The task of algorithm selection involves choosing an algorithm from a set of algorithms on a per-instance basis in order to exploit the varying performance of algorithms over a set of instances. The algorithm selection problem is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in {AI.} Years of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data. This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios. To demonstrate the breadth and power of our platform, we describe a study that builds and evaluates algorithm selection models through a common interface. The results display the potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.},

  abstract={This research note contains an extension of a previous work by Cabalar and Santos (2011) that formalised several spatial puzzles formed by strings and holes. That approach explicitly ignored some configurations and actions that were irrelevant for the studied puzzles but are physically possible and may become crucial for other spatial reasoning problems. In particular, the previous work did not consider the formation of string loops or the situations where a holed object is partially crossed by another holed object. In this paper, we remove these limitations by treating string loops as dynamic holes that can be created or destroyed by a pair of elementary actions, respectively picking or pulling from strings. We explain how string loops can be recognised in a data structure representing the domain states and define a notation to represent crossings through string loops. The resulting formalism is dual in the sense that it also allows understanding any hole as a kind of (sometimes rigid) closed string loop.},

Unlike Hoare's logic, our approach does not rely on loop invariants. Unlike the typical temporal logic specification of a program, our translation does not require a transition system model of the program, and is compositional on the structures of the program. Some non-trivial examples are given to show the effectiveness of our translation for proving properties of programs.},

The author is allowed to merge articles; this may affect the H-index. We analyze the (parameterized) computational complexity of maximizing the H-index using article merges. Herein, to model realistic manipulation scenarios, we define a compatibility graph whose edges correspond to plausible merges. Moreover, we consider several different measures for computing the citation count of a merged article. For the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm that maximizes the H-index in linear time if the compatibility graph has constant-size connected components. In contrast, if we allow to merge arbitrary articles (that is, for compatibility graphs that are cliques), then already increasing the H-index by one is {NP-hard.} Experiments on Google Scholar profiles of {AI} researchers show that the H-index can be manipulated substantially only if one merges articles with highly dissimilar titles.},

We investigate how this requirement can be met by theories developed within the framework of circumscription, and specify a constraint – the exemption principle – that must be satisfied to do so. This principle determines in cases of conflicting default rules which objects are exempted from which rules, and, as such, is the main source for the capricious logical behavior of the sentences we are interested {in.To} facilitate comparison (and implementation) we supply an algorithm for inheritance networks and prove that arguments that can be expressed in both frameworks are valid on the circumscriptive account if and only if the inheritance algorithm has a positive outcome.},

  abstract={Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine {(5-HT))} is a neurotransmitter that has an essential role in the regulation of emotion. However, the precise circuits have not yet been defined through which aversive states are orchestrated by {5-HT.} Here we show that {5-HT} from the dorsal raphe nucleus {(5-HT(DRN))} enhances fear and anxiety and activates a subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing factor {(CRF)} neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis {(CRF(BNST))} in mice. Specifically, {5-HT(DRN)} projections to the {BNST,} via actions at {5-HT2C} receptors {(5-HT2CRs),} engage a {CRF(BNST)} inhibitory microcircuit that silences anxiolytic {BNST} outputs to the ventral tegmental area and lateral hypothalamus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this {CRF(BNST)} inhibitory circuit underlies aversive behaviour following acute exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors {(SSRIs).} This early aversive effect is mediated via the corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor {(CRF1R,} also known as {CRHR1),} given that {CRF1R} antagonism is sufficient to prevent acute {SSRI-induced} enhancements in aversive learning. These results reveal an essential {5-HT(DRN)→CRF(BNST)} circuit governing fear and anxiety, and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the clinical observation of early adverse events to {SSRI} treatment in some patients with anxiety disorders.},

  abstract={It is prevalent that the Pareto-based dominant framework is inefficient in non-dominated sorting because the performance sharply deteriorates when there are numerous weak dominance relations. In order to address this issue, the paper presents a novel ranking strategy called Global Margin Ranking {(GMR)} which deploys the position information of individuals in objective space to gain the margin of dominance throughout the population. The method not only considers the distribution of population, but also incorporates the associated information of individuals, without incurring user-defined parameters. Moreover, in view of the challenges faced by Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization {(MOPSO)} in selection of {gBest} and {pBest,} we present an innovative strategy for selecting {gBest} and {pBest} by integrating the {GMR} and the individual’s density information. We compare the {GMR} method with a variety of other ranking methods in terms of the distribution of ranks, the ranking landscape and convergence of the evolutionary process. The relatively extensive experimental results on some benchmark functions show that {MOPSO/GMR} performs better than those specialized {MOEAs.}},
